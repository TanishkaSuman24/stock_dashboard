This is my final project from the Python for Data Science & AI course.
I learned how to leverage Python for data analysis and showcased my skills in this project where I used web scraping to analyze the stock and revenue of major companies on the market.
I utilized Pandas and the BeautifulSoup libraries to automate this process and create visualizations that present the information in a user-friendly way.
